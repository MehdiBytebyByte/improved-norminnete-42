# Welcome to the Most Useless Repository Ever!

Congratulations on finding this repository! You're in for a treat with these three groundbreaking scripts that will revolutionize your coding experience. Or not.

## Script 1: Norminette Clicker

This script is so advanced that it can magically click the "Norminette" button for you. Just run it and watch the magic happen. It's like having your own personal code style police!

## Script 2: .gitignore Generator Extraordinaire

Tired of manually creating .gitignore files? Fear not! This script will generate the most comprehensive .gitignore file you've ever seen. It knows exactly what files you don't want to commit, even before you do!

## Script 3: File Obliterator

Say goodbye to unnecessary files cluttering your project! This script will mercilessly delete any file it deems unnecessary. Who needs backups or caution, right? Just run it and watch your files vanish into thin air.
