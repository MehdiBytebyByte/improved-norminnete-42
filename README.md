# üöÄ Welcome to the Most Useless Repository Ever!  

Congratulations on discovering this masterpiece of unproductivity! Here, you'll find **three groundbreaking scripts** that will (probably not) revolutionize your coding experience.  

## üéØ Requirements  

Before diving into these gems, make sure you have the following:  
- **Bash** (or an equivalent shell) installed on your system.  
- Permissions to execute the scripts. You can set this using:  
  ```bash
  chmod +x filename.sh
üõ†Ô∏è Pro Tip
To save yourself the hassle of cloning this repository every time, you can:

Place the scripts in your home directory (or another accessible location).
Create an alias to run them from anywhere. For example:
``alias nn='/Users/YOUR-USERNAME/path-to-repo/improvednorminette.sh'``
üß© The Scripts
1Ô∏è‚É£ Norminette Clicker
Tired of manually clicking the "Norminette" button? This script does it for you!
Think of it as your personal code-style police, ensuring compliance with minimal effort.

2Ô∏è‚É£ .gitignore Generator Extraordinaire
Wave goodbye to the tedious task of writing .gitignore files. This script will create the perfect .gitignore file for you, so you can focus on what matters‚Äîwriting (or breaking) code!

3Ô∏è‚É£ File Obliterator
Got unnecessary files cluttering your project? This script will ruthlessly delete them.
Use with care‚Äîthis one doesn't believe in backups or second chances!

‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer
These scripts are for entertainment purposes only and might not always be practical. Use them responsibly‚Äîor better yet, don't use them at all.

ü•≥ Happy Coding!
Enjoy exploring the quirks of this repository. Remember, the journey is more important than the destination‚Äîespecially when the destination is this useless!
