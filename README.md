# Welcome to the Most Useless Repository Ever!

Congratulations on finding this repository! You're in for a treat with these three groundbreaking scripts that will revolutionize your coding experience. Or not.

## Notice
you need to give the permissions of the file in order to be executed using this command on your  file
``chmod +x filename.sh``
also, I would recommend you put the files in your home or something and make an alias to be able to use them everywhere without needing to clone them each time
`` alias nn='/Users/YOUR-USERNAME/improved-norminnete-42/improvednorminette.sh'``

## Script 1: Norminette Clicker

This script is so advanced that it can magically click the "Norminette" button for you. Just run it and watch the magic happen. It's like having your own personal code-style police!

## Script 2: .gitignore Generator Extraordinaire

Are you tired of manually creating .gitignore files? Fear not! This script will generate the most comprehensive .gitignore file you've ever seen. It knows exactly what files you don't want to commit, even before you do!

## Script 3: File Obliterator

Say goodbye to unnecessary files cluttering your project! This script will mercilessly delete any file it deems superfluous. Who needs backups or caution, right? Just run it and watch your files vanish into thin air.

## Disclaimer

Please note that these scripts are purely for entertainment purposes and should not be taken seriously. Use them at your own risk, or better yet, don't use them at all.

Happy coding!
